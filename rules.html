        <p>The rules of Chess.
            <br> The player with “white” pieces makes the first move. After the first move the player with the “black” pieces makes the second move. Players then alternate moves until the game reaches one of four conclusions: Reaching the time limit, Checkmate, Draw or Resignation. 
            A game of chess usually has a time limit in which a player must make their moves to reach the goal - checkmate. If the time runs out, the game ends with a win for the player that still has time left.
            Checkmate is given when a player’s king is threatened with capture and there’s no way to evade the capture. Draw (neither of the player wins) can occur in various situations. A game of chess always has a limit to the moves players are allowed to make in repetition as well as the legal cap on moves in general (usually fifty moves). So the game can be drawn by repetition of moves, reaching the set move limit or when players reach a “dead position”. Dead position can be reached when there’s no possible way for players to checkmate one-another, for example when only kings remain in play. Players can also opt to resign the game if they choose to, which leads to the other player winning the game. Stalemate is a situation in which the opposing player has no legal moves left - leads to a draw. Players are also able to agree to a draw if one offers so.

# Chess-101

Hi, 

This is a school project in which we were assigned to create a basic HTML5 website. 
I decided to create mine about Chess. The early stages involves a lot of trial and error, so it can evolve drastically compared
to the final, polished version. The only reason for me to upload it here is to make it public and track the progression.

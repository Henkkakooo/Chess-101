                <h2 >Chess Teaches You How To Win And Lose </h2>
                <h3 onclick="expand(this)">Of course, everyone likes to win... 
                    <span style="display:none;">, but it is 
                    just important to learn how to accept losing. 
                    As the saying goes—sometimes you give the lesson,
                    and sometimes you receive the lesson! Most importantly,
                    try to learn from those losses and come back as a 
                    better player. Just as in life, we need to get back
                    up when confronted with failure and come back stronger 
                    and wiser. Winning with grace is an important character
                    trait that chess can teach a person.

                <h3 onclick="expand(this)">As Bobby Fischer said... <span style="display:none;">, "Chess demands total concentration."
                    A chess player can make moves like a grandmaster for 30 moves
                    and then get distracted on move 31 and make an elementary
                    blunder that loses the game! This intense focus is useful in
                    everyday life when confronted with school assignments, daily
                    tasks, and deadlines.</span></h3>
                <h2 >Chess Build Confidence</h2>
                <h3 onclick="expand(this)">Chess is all you—you put in the time studying... <span style="display:none;">, you put
                    in the time competing in tournaments, you spend the time
                    analyzing your losses and finding your weaknesses. With
                    all this work a sense of confidence is developed. Even
                    working through a tough period where you plateau in
                    your chess development can help you build resilience and confidence.</span></h3>

                <h3 onclick="expand(this)">In every chess game, you are faced with challenges and problems... <span style="display:none;">
                    that you have to solve in order to play your best game. Chess
                    can help you to think ahead, not rush your decisions, and weigh
                    the pluses and minuses of your choices. This correlates to
                    challenges we face in everyday life, and just as in chess,
                    we try to make the best choices to develop positive outcomes
                    for our lives.</span></h3>
                <h2 >Chess Helps You Learn How To Be Calm Under Pressure</h2>

                    your brain can work to its maximum. We are all faced
                    with deadlines, presentations, interviews, and tests
                    throughout our life. Just as in a chess game, we have
                    to remain confident and calm to perform our best.</span> </h3>
